            Certifications are designated credentials earned by an individual to
            verify their legitimacy and competence to perform a job. Your
            certification is typically displayed as a document stating that as a
            professional, youâ€™ve been trained, educated, and are prepared to
            meet a specific set of criteria for your role.
